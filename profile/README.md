_Are you struggling to find diet recipes that suit your specific needs?_

Many people find it difficult to maintain a healthy diet and routine exercise because it's hard to find recipes that suit their needs. When it comes to dieting, most people think that low-fat foods are the best for dieting. However, it’s not just that, a balanced diet and activity that makes a healthy lifestyle for dieting.

## Introducing Diet!n
Diet!n (_pronounced Diet-in_) is an intelligent app that can help users find out the number of calories they need in a day, then recommend diet recipes that match the user's preferences.

The app will first ask questions about the user's personal dietary preferences. The app will learn from the user's input to give the user calorie output according to the user's input.

Through this app, we want to help people who are on a diet and healthy lifestyle to maximize their diet!

## Development
Diet!n in on an early development stage as of late May 2023 with machine learning, mobile development, and cloud computing team working together on building the app.
